# Machine Learning Deep Learning project
> A collection of hands-on machine learning and deep learning projects, including image classification, text classification, and summarization with modern frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace)

## Overview
This repository contains three end-to-end machine learning and deep learning projects designed to illustrate practical AI workflows from dataset preparation to model evaluation and deployment readiness.

Each notebook demonstrates a different aspect of data-centric AI and model engineering:
- Image Classification (CNN): Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images (CIFAR-10 or custom dataset) with TensorFlow / Keras.
- Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis): Fine-tunes DistilBERT on the IMDB dataset for binary sentiment classification with Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch.
- Text Summarization (BART Model): Generates concise summaries from long passages using facebook/bart-large-cnn and Hugging Face Transformers.
